This is a real-world project that I worked on as part of a group. We used USA superstore data and began by cleaning and preparing the data for analysis. 
We then utilized various SQL concepts, including joins, subqueries, window functions, group by, and others, to solve the problem statement. The project 
involved analyzing data from multiple tables, identifying patterns, and extracting meaningful insights to help improve business performance. Overall, 
this project required strong teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills, as well as a solid understanding of SQL and its applications.
