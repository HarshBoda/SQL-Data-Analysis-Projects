In this project, I worked with 'super store order analysis data to solve the problem statement by utilizing complex SQL queries. 
I applied various SQL concepts such as joins, group by, aggregate functions, window functions, and subqueries to obtain the desired results. 
The queries involved analyzing the data from multiple tables and using advanced functions to extract meaningful insights. Overall, the project required a 
strong understanding of SQL and the ability to apply complex queries to a real-world scenario.
