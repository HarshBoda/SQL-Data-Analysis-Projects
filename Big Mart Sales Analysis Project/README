The Big Mart sales Analysis project involves working with a dataset that contains information on various items sold at Big Mart stores, such as their weight, 
fat content, visibility, type, and maximum retail price. It also includes information about the stores themselves, such as their establishment year, size, location type, 
and outlet type. The final variable in the dataset is the item outlet sales.

To analyze this data, SQL concepts such as joins, window functions, subqueries, group by, and aggregate functions have been utilized. Joins are used to combine 
data from multiple tables, while window functions are used to perform calculations on subsets of data based on a specified window. Subqueries are used to retrieve 
data from one table based on conditions in another table. Group by is used to group data based on a particular column or set of columns, and aggregate functions are 
used to perform calculations on these groups.

By using these SQL concepts, the project has been able to derive useful insights from the dataset, which could help in making decisions related to sales strategies, 
inventory management, and store operations.
